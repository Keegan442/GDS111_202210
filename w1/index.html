    <h2>My Bio</h2>

    <p>Whats up! I'm Keegan Preston and I'm from Wakefield, Rhode Island. I like a whole bunch of stuff! I like skating, games, movies, art, music, and a bunch more! One of my favorite hobbies, though, is <b>skateboarding</b>. I started skating when I was ten years old and fell in love with it. I took a couple year break, then came back to it and was more into it than ever. Now, I can do a bunch of tricks and am very into the culture of skating. <br>Another hobby that I'm very into is music. One of my favorite artists of all time is <i>MF DOOM</i>. He started making music when he was younger in a group called KMD with his brother. After the death of his brother, he took a break, but then came back in 1999 with his first solo studio album called "Operation: Doomsday" and everyone was stunned with his unique production style and innovative rap style. After that he kept topping himself with album after album becomming better and better. </p>
